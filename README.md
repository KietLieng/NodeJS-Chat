# Introduction I'm splitting this into casual users and developers
## casual users view - download and double-click get to chatting
### Windows OS
1. Download the files
2. Double-click on the start.bat
3. Point the browser to one of the following URL's on the prompt
4. ????
5. Profit!

## Developers view - you want to develop the program as it's moving along
1.  Install node.js http://nodejs.org/
2.  unzp the code to a directory
3.  run node index.js
4.  goto localhost:3000 (the terminal will also tell you available ip's to use also)

Caveats to look out for:  If you want a clean setup you can just download the json.package, index.js and index.html page and recreate the node.js environment by using npm (node package manager).

1. create new directory.
2. run npm update
3. run npm install express
4. run npm install socket.io
5. drop the 3 index files (mentioned above) here.
5. run node index.js
4.  goto localhost:3000 (the terminal will also tell you available ip's to use also)
